## Quickstart

```bash
sudo apt install golang
```

To run like Python:
```bash
go run main.go arg1 arg2
```

To build executable:
```bash
go build main.go
```

Usage:
```bash
non@woa:~/program$ go run main.go 
[-] Usage: ./program vulnerable/web?param= 'ls -la'
```

## To Do:
- Reverse shell capabilities (https://gobyexample.com/spawning-processes)
- Better error handling, know there is a logic bug where if you change ?search to ?sea, program flow still reaches command success end line
